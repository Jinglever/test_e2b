1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files. It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that might be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that correspond to the ones in the "index.html" file. It will also import the "tailwind.css" file to use its utility classes.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be imported in the "styles.css" file and its classes will be used in the "index.html" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are the unique identifiers for HTML elements. They are shared between "index.html" and "styles.css" for styling purposes, and potentially with JavaScript functions for DOM manipulation.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers for HTML elements that are used to apply styles. They are shared between "index.html", "styles.css", and "tailwind.css".

3. CSS Selectors: These are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. They are shared between "index.html" and "styles.css".

4. Import Statements: These are used to import the "tailwind.css" file into the "styles.css" file, and to link both CSS files to the "index.html" file.

5. HTML Tags: These are used to create elements on the web page. They are shared between "index.html" and "styles.css" for styling purposes.

Note: As there is no JavaScript file or function names mentioned in the prompt, they are not included in the shared dependencies.
